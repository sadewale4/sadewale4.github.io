# Welcome to My Portfolio Website

Hello — I’m **Samson Adewale**, a Senior Cybersecurity Engineer specializing in **Cloud Security**, **DevSecOps**, and **Cloud-Native architectures**. If you're here, you likely care about building secure systems, pushing innovation in security operations, or exploring how AI / LLMs can transform the way we defend infrastructure.  

Over my years in this field, I’ve seen a lot of change: new threats, evolving tools, shifting paradigms. This site is my space to share what works, what doesn’t, and what I believe the future holds. I want it to be useful to you — whether you’re a developer, defender, DevOps engineer, or just curious.

## What You’ll Find Here

Here’s the kind of content I’ll be posting, regularly:

- **Technical Projects & Case Studies** – real work I’ve done: building secure platforms, cloud infrastructure, incident response tooling, automations.  
- **Hands-On Tutorials & Deep Dives** – things like securing CI/CD pipelines, Infrastructure as Code, Kubernetes hardening, observability, managing cloud drift.  
- **Thought Leadership & Industry Trends** – reflections on where security operations have been, where they are now, what’s ahead (particularly around AI, automation, threat detection, cloud-native security).  
- **Lessons from the Field** – mistakes, surprises, wins; what I learned building and defending at scale.  
- **Resources & Recommendations** – tools, papers, open-source projects, learning paths I’ve found helpful.

## My Main Focus Areas

These are the technical domains and themes that I live in, where most of my work and writing will center.

- **Cloud Security** – identity & access management, data protection & encryption, network segmentation, governance & compliance across AWS, Azure, GCP, hybrid & multi-cloud setups.  
- **DevSecOps** – integrating security early and often in development, IaC scanning, automated testing, building security into deployment pipelines, vulnerability management.  
- **Cloud-Native Architecture** – containers, Kubernetes, service meshes, serverless, runtime security, observability, drift detection and securing ephemeral and dynamic infrastructure.  
- **AI & LLMs in Security Operations** – automating threat detection, improving alert triage, accelerating response, improving context awareness, while carefully managing ethics, trust, errors.

## What’s Coming Soon

To give you a taste, here are some upcoming posts:

1. **SecOps Challenges Today**: alert fatigue, tool sprawl, balancing speed with safety.  
2. **Automation & AI Case Studies**: building a tool / pipeline that reduced response time by X, or detecting misconfigurations proactively.  
3. **Tutorials**: secure IaC practices, setting up observability for cloud-native workloads, building safe automated remediation workflows.  
4. **Thinking Ahead**: predictions for threat-landscape shifts, cloud-native security’s next frontiers, what happens when AI plays a bigger role in SecOps.

## Why I Built This

I built this site because I believe **defensive security must evolve continuously**. Attackers are innovating. Infrastructure is shifting (cloud, hybrid, serverless). Scale is increasing. If we don’t adapt, we’ll always be a step behind.  

This is also a promise to myself — to keep learning, push boundaries, document what I try (successes and failures), and share. And if something I write helps you — gives you an insight, saves you time, inspires you — that’s a win.

## Let’s Connect & Collaborate

Security is a team sport. I want to hear from you — fellow engineers, builders, defenders, dreamers. Feedback, questions, ideas, war stories — all welcome.
