# AI SecOps: Noise Into Insight

**Presentation at BSides Atlanta 2025**

## Abstract

As security operations centers face increasing alert volumes and analyst burnout, AI agents present a promising solution for augmenting human capabilities. This presentation explores practical approaches to integrating AI agents into SecOps workflows, from alert triage to automated response.

## Key Topics

- Current challenges in security operations (alert fatigue, analyst shortage, tool sprawl)
- Understanding AI agents vs traditional automation
- Real-world use cases: alert enrichment, incident summarization, playbook generation
- Building trustworthy AI agents for security
- Measuring impact and ROI
- Lessons learned and pitfalls to avoid

## Takeaways

Attendees will leave with:
- Practical frameworks for evaluating AI agent use cases in SecOps
- Implementation patterns and reference architectures
- Understanding of risks and mitigation strategies
- Real metrics from production deployments
